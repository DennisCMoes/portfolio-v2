[//] **Building My Custom ORM in Java: A Deep Dive**

The idea of creating a custom ORM first struck me during a project where I found myself writing repetitive SQL code. Every SELECT or INSERT statement felt like I was reinventing the wheel. What if I could automate these tedious tasks?

That's when I decided to build my own ORMâ€”a tool that would map Java objects to SQL tables seamlessly. While popular libraries like Hibernate exist, I wanted to explore the mechanics under the hood and build something tailored to my needs.

## **Starting Point: Mapping Classes to Tables**

The cornerstone of any ORM is its ability to map classes to database tables. For this, I relied heavily on Java annotations. Here's an example of how a simple User class is represented:

<CodeBlockComponent language='java' code={
`@Entity
  @Table(name = "users")
  public class User {
    @Id
	  private int id;
	  private String name;
	  private String email;

      // Getters and setters
      public User(int id, String name, String email) {
    	  this.id = id;
    	  this.name = name;
    	  this.email = email;
      }

}
`}
/>

Annotations like <InlineCodeComponent text='@Entity' />, <InlineCodeComponent text='@Table' />, and <InlineCodeComponent text='@Id' /> allowed me to define the relationship between a Java class and its corresponding table. The ORM parses these annotations using Java's reflection API to generate SQL dynamically.

## **The Magic of Reflection**

Reflection became the backbone of the project. By scanning class fields at runtime, the ORM identifies which properties map to database columns. Here's a snippet of the code that achieves this:

<CodeBlockComponent language='java' code={
  `public <T> String generateInsertQuery(Class<T> clazz) {
	  StringBuilder query = new StringBuilder("INSERT INTO ");
	  Table table = clazz.getAnnotation(Table.class);
	  query.append(table.name()).append(" (");

      // Get all fields
      Field[] fields = clazz.getDeclaredFields();
      for (Field field : fields) {
    	  query.append(field.getName()).append(", ");
      }

      query.delete(query.length() - 2, query.length()).append(") VALUES (");

      // Generate placeholders for values
      query.append("?, ".repeat(fields.length));

      query.delete(query.length() - 2, query.length()).append(")");

      return query.toString();

}
`}
/>

This method constructs INSERT statements by:

1. Extracting the table name from the <InlineCodeComponent text='@Table' /> annotation.
2. Iterating through the class fields to build column names.
3. Appending placeholders (?) for prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.

For a class like User, the resulting query looks like this:

<CodeBlockComponent
  language="sql"
  code={'INSERT INTO users (id, name, email) VALUES (?, ?, ?);'}
/>

## **Executing CRUD Operations**

With query generation in place, the next step was handling Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations. The save method, for instance, inserts a new object into the database:

<CodeBlockComponent language="java" code={
`public <T> void save(T entity) {
	  String query = generateInsertQuery(entity.getClass());

      try (PreparedStatement statement = connection.prepareStatement(query)) {
    	  Field[] fields = entity.getClass().getDeclaredFields();

    	  // Set parameter values
    	  for (int i = 0; i < fields.length; i++) {
    		  fields[i].setAccessible(true);
    		  statement.setObject(i + 1, fields[i].get(entity));
    	  }

    	  statement.executeUpdate();
      } catch (SQLException | IllegalAccessException e) {
    	  e.printStackTrace();
      }

}`}/>

This method:

- Dynamically builds the INSERT statement.
- Uses reflection to extract values from the object and map them to query parameters.
- Executes the statement to save the data into the database.

Here's how it works in practice:

<CodeBlockComponent
  language="java"
  code={`User user = new User(1, "John Doe", "john@example.com");
orm.save(user);`}
/>

## **Reading Data: Querying the Database**

Fetching data is where the ORM shines. With a single line of code, you can retrieve an object from the database:

<CodeBlockComponent
  language="java"
  code={'User user = orm.find(User.class, 1);'}
/>

Here's how the find method works:

<CodeBlockComponent language="java" code={
`public <T> T find(Class<T> clazz, Object id) {
	  String query = "SELECT * FROM " + clazz.getAnnotation(Table.class).name() + " WHERE id = ?";

      try (PreparedStatement statement = connection.prepareStatement(query)) {
    	  statement.setObject(1, id);
    	  ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery();

    	  if (resultSet.next()) {
    		  T instance = clazz.getDeclaredConstructor().newInstance();

        for (Field field : clazz.getDeclaredFields()) {
          field.setAccessible(true);
          field.set(instance, resultSet.getObject(field.getName()));
        }

        return instance;
      }
    } catch (Exception e) {
      e.printStackTrace();
    }
    return null;

}`}

/>

This method dynamically:

1. Builds the SELECT query using the table name and primary key.
2. Maps the result set back to the object fields using reflection.

## **Handling Relationships**

The ORM also supports simple relationships between entities, such as OneToMany and ManyToOne. For example, a Post class might reference a User:

<CodeBlockComponent language="java" code={
`@Entity
@Table(name = "posts")
public class Post {
    @Id
    private int id;
    private String content;

    @ManyToOne
    @JoinColumn(name = "user_id")
    private User author;

}`} />

The ORM parses the <InlineCodeComponent text='@ManyToOne' /> annotation to handle foreign key constraints and fetch related data.

## **Challenges and Lessons Learned**

Building this ORM wasn't without its challenges. For instance:

- **SQL Injection Prevention:** Using prepared statements for every query ensured security.
- **Connection Management:** Efficiently managing database connections and ensuring thread safety was crucial. Implementing connection pooling was a game-changer.
- **Reflection Overhead:** While reflection is powerful, it comes with performance costs. Careful caching of metadata helped mitigate this.

## **What I Learned**

This project gave me a deeper appreciation for the design and complexity of mature ORMs like Hibernate. Some of the key lessons include:

- The importance of clean abstraction in software design.
- How Java's reflection API unlocks dynamic behavior at runtime.
- The trade-offs between flexibility and performance when building custom solutions.

## **Conclusion**

Developing this ORM has been a rewarding journey. It's not just about building a tool but about understanding the inner workings of how Java applications interact with databases. While it's unlikely to replace Hibernate in production, this ORM serves as a testament to the value of learning by doing.
