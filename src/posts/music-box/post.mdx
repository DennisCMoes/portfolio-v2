After diving into a few projects with React Native, I decided that it was time to explore a new frontier: the Flutter ecosystem. Just as I had with React native, I started my Flutter journey by following a few tutorials. Once I felt confident enough, I started my own application, and thus, MusicBox was born.

## Introducing MusicBox

MusicBox is a "functional" music player app with a sleek design. The home screen showcases the top songs of the year. When you select a song, it opens up in the music player, ready to play your favorite tunes (without functioning sound).

## Features

### Home Screen

The home screen displays the top songs of the year. It's a simple yet effective way to discover and play popular tracks.

### Playlist and Favourites Screen

MusicBox features a dedicated screen for playlists and favorite songs. You can view your favorite tracks, organized by playlists. This functionality is achieved by temporarily storing data in the app's state.

### Music Playing Screen

When a user clicks on a song, the music player screen opens. Here, you can listen to your favorite song and enjoy various UI options, including:

### Play, Next, Back, Shuffle, and Repeat buttons

Additionally, swiping up from the bottom reveals a lyrics tab and an "Up Next" tab, helping you keep track of upcoming songs.

### Local State Management with GetX

For managing local state, I chose GetX over bloC. In my opinion, GetX is more intuitive and easier to learn. It also offers additional features, such as simple page transitions.

To implement state management, I created a StoreController and extended it with GetXController. Here's a glimpse of the code:

```dart
class StoreController extends GetXController {
  // Variables that are observable
  final isPlaying = false.obs;

  // Functions that change the observable variables
  void updateIsPlaying(bool status) {
    isPlaying.value = status;
  }

  void addFavoriteSong(String name, String artist) {
    // Logic to add song to favorites
  }
}
```

In the app pages, I call these functions to handle state management efficiently:

```dart
final storeController = Get.put(StoreController());

storeController.updateIsPlaying(true);
```

## Conclusion

Creating MusicBox with Flutter has been an enjoyable and rewarding experience. Integrating essential music player features and managing local state with GetX has allowed me to create an app that I am proud of. I look forward to further exploring the Flutter framework and developing more applications in the future.
