This markdown file provides documentation for an imaginary project written in Java using the Spring Boot framework with MongoDB as the database.

## Project Overview

The project aims to develop a RESTful API using Java and Spring Boot for a task management application. MongoDB is used as the database to store task-related information.

## Project Structure

The project follows a standard structure for a Spring Boot application:

```bash
project-y/
├── src/
│   ├── main/
│   │   ├── java/
│   │   │   └── com/
│   │   │       └── example/
│   │   │           └── projecty/
│   │   │               ├── controller/
│   │   │               ├── model/
│   │   │               ├── repository/

├── mvnw
├── mvnw.cmd
├── pom.xml
└── README.md
```

src: Contains the source code of the application.
    main: Contains the main Java source code.
        java: Contains the Java packages and classes.
            com.example.projecty.controller: Defines the RESTful API controllers.
            com.example.projecty.model: Defines the data models used in the application.
            com.example.projecty.repository: Implements the repository pattern for interacting with MongoDB.
            com.example.projecty.service: Contains the business logic and interacts with the repositories.
            ProjectYApplication.java: The main entry point of the Spring Boot application.
            Application.properties: Contains the application-specific configuration.
    resources: Contains the application resources such as static files and templates.
test: Contains unit and integration tests for the application.
.gitignore: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by version control.
mvnw, mvnw.cmd: Maven wrapper scripts.
pom.xml: The Maven project configuration file.
README.md: Provides general information and instructions about the project.

Dependencies

The project relies on the following dependencies:

Java: A popular programming language.
Spring Boot: A framework for building Java applications.
MongoDB: A flexible and scalable NoSQL database.
Maven: A build automation and dependency management tool.

To build and run the project, make sure Java and Maven are installed on your system.
Database Configuration

To connect to the MongoDB database, you need to provide the necessary configuration. Open the Application.properties file and modify the following lines:

properties

```bash
spring.data.mongodb.host=your_mongodb_host
spring.data.mongodb.port=your_mongodb_port
spring.data.mongodb.database=your_mongodb_database
```

Replace the placeholder values (your_mongodb_host, your_mongodb_port, your_mongodb_database) with your MongoDB database details.
Building and Running the Application

To build and run the application, navigate to the project directory and execute the following command:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

This will build the project, download the necessary dependencies, and start the Spring Boot application.
Testing the API

The project includes unit and integration tests to ensure the functionality of different components. You can run the tests using the following command:

```bash
mvn test
```

This will execute the test files located in the test/ directory.
Conclusion

This imaginary project provides a foundation for building a RESTful API for task management using Java, Spring Boot, and MongoDB. Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your requirements.
