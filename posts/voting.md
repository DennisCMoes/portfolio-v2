In recent times, voting has become a prominent and contentious issue, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic and the recent American elections. Concerns about fraud and the use of mail-in ballots have emerged, leading to questions about the legitimacy of votes cast from home. While the truth of these claims remains uncertain, it is evident that there is a need for increased transparency in the voting process. One potential solution to this problem is the implementation of blockchain technology.

The aim of this project is to explore the feasibility of implementing an electronic national election system utilizing blockchain technology, with the goal of enhancing the efficiency and transparency of the voting process.

In response to the call for improved voting procedures, our team sought to leverage modern technology to revolutionize the electoral process. The primary objective was to investigate the viability of an electronic voting system built on a secure blockchain platform.

## The Chaincode

The crux of our blockchain application lies in the chaincode, the smart contract that defines the rules governing the network. TypeScript takes center stage in this critical component, providing a statically typed and expressive environment for developing intricate blockchain logic.

Hyperledger Fabric's framework, with its modular and scalable architecture, seamlessly integrates with TypeScript, allowing developers to articulate complex smart contracts with precision. TypeScript's static typing proves invaluable, offering enhanced code reliability and maintainability, crucial for the integrity of our blockchain.

The use of TypeScript in the chaincode ensures that our application benefits from modern language features, making the development process more efficient while reducing the likelihood of runtime errors. This combination of technologies lays the groundwork for a resilient and secure blockchain core.

## The API

The API is also written in TypeScript and uses express.

## The Frontend

The frontend uses NextJS and TypeScript.
